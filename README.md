Project is not fully operational yet. Expect there
to be sub-optimal components in processing, and there
are incomplete decision-making pipelines.

There are plans to write a paper detailing the 
application and operation of this project. The 
paper will come by 7/1/2024. 

TLDR; the project simulates security breaches 
on a network that is supposed to guard against
3rd-party intrusion into sensitive data.
