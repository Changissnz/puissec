# PUISSEC 

Pronunciation: pwoy-sec  
Derivation: poised/poison+security  
Meaning: the technique of data poisoning
         as a combative technique involving
         target information in the context 
         of a secure environment with a 
         level of awareness used to defend 
         against agent intruders. 

Project is not fully operational yet. Expect there
to be sub-optimal components in processing, and there
are incomplete decision-making pipelines.

There are plans to write a paper detailing the 
application and operation of this project. The 
paper will come by 7/1/2024. 

TLDR; the project simulates security breaches 
on a network that is supposed to guard against
3rd-party intrusion into sensitive data.

### Update 06/14/2024
The finalized paper for this project will not be 
complete by 7/1/2024 due to continuing work on 
technical issues. 

### Update 08/01/2024
An incomplete draft of the paper is found in 
`paper`. Also added MIT license.

### Update 08/11/2024
There are no plans to implement elaborate 
data poisoning features to Puissec. Data 
poisoning would be relatively easy for 
those educated in data science and programming
to implement.

### Update 08/20/2024
The paper has two sections remaining to be written.

### Update 08/29/2024

The first draft of the paper has been finalized. 
Project cleaning/review is planned. A lot of junk/comment 
code has been deleted.

### Update 09/01/2024

Some additional work and thoughts are planned to be added to the paper. 
These paper updates will roughly coincide with current developments 
revolving around `psec_env.py`. 

### Update 09/17/2024
Open development of project has been placed in the zone of uncertainty.
Most of the bugs have been fixed. There is certainly room for improvement.
Some concepts from the paper have not yet been implemented. The developer
of this project has become preoccupied with other questions.
